Title: MergeX — Smart Tab Manager

Short description: Merge windows, prevent duplicate tabs, and organize tabs by domain/time — fast and simple.

Long description:

MergeX keeps your browsing tidy with one-click tab management.

- Merge tabs across all windows into the current one (preserves tab groups)
- Prevent duplicate tabs: scope within the same window, automatically closes the previous tab
- Sort tabs by domain, group by domain or last access time, or ungroup all
- Quick toggles in the popup: Prevent duplicates, Protect current URL, Ignore query
- Settings overview page: inspect protected entries, delete when needed

Why MergeX?
- Clean, minimal UI with sensible defaults
- Lightweight, fast, and privacy-friendly (no external services)
